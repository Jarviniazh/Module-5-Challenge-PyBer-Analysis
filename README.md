# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO of PyBer, a ride-sharing app company. By using pandas and matplotlib libraries, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The analysis and visualizations you produce will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for understand neighborhoods.

## Results
The rideshare data contains three types of city: Urban, Suburban and Rural. Below is the overall output of these three city types.

Letâ€™s go over each influential factor
- Rides per city type: It is so obvious that most rides happened in urban area, reaching 68.4% of total ride demand. With the other 26.3% from suburban, this two city type almost dominate the PyBer ride-sharing market. For rural area, only about 5% contributes to the total.

- Drivers per city type: The same percentage trend shows on drivers data. About four fifths drivers (80.9%) from urban. In contrast, the number of rural driver narrow down to only 2.6%. It seems the larger market the more drivers would like to try ride-sharing.

- Fares per city type: There is no doudt that the urban area with largest rides amount leads the highest revenue in 2019 again. However, due to the low supply of drivers, average fare prices in Rural areas are the highest of any city type, and accounts for 6.8% the total fares.

- Total weekly per city type: We analyze the rideshare data from January 1, 2019 through April 29, 2019, and the first two months of 2019 display a static trend regardless the city type. Urban income in March is more fluctuant than the other two city type and turns flat again in April, whereas the fares from suburban area starts climbing up.

## Summary
Based on the results, we could come up with three recommendations to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for understand neighborhoods.
1. Rural area currently has highest avaerage fare per ride as well as highest avaerage fare per driver. To increase rural users, PyBer should attract more rural drivers to provide ride-sharing service. The proper promotion strategy might be tempting welcome coupon and  better incentives. 
2. Since there were abundant drivers in urban area. PyBer should retrieve demographic data in this area to analyze the market share and be aware of the market saturation in the future. The promotion plan should focus on retain loyalty users.
3. For suburban area, make up 26.3% of rides but only 16.5%. The company should also attract more drivers to join and also retain all the current users, so that PyBer could improve the affordability and accessibility.
